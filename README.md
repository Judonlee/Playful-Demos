# Playful-Demos

A series of Playful demos that take advantage of WebRTC, Web Audio API and other new HTML5/JS technologies.

## Demo 01

Microphone input to demonstrate different types of sound (spoken opposite to other types).
A looped piece of background sound is played while the recorded audio speaks over the top.
When a human voice is heard from the Microphone, the recorded audio finishes its sentence and waits a 5 seconds before continuing.
Of course the background sound keeps looping throughout.

Ian provided background sounds from Derek Tangye documentary and even part of the transcript to make it quick and easy.

### VAD - Voice Activity Detection

This turns out to be pretty tricky and is the subject of PhDs and tends to be proprietary since it is used all over the place:
* To save data when not talking during a conversation on a mobile phone.
* To detect that a human answered the phone and then connects you to a sales operator.
* Echo cancellation.
